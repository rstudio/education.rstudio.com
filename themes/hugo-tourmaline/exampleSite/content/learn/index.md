<h2 class='noTrickPadding' id='r4ds'>R for data science</h2>

The best place to start learning the tidyverse is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) (R4DS for short), an O'Reilly book written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It's designed to take you from knowing nothing about R or the tidyverse to having all the basic tools of data science at your fingertips. You can read it online for free, or [buy a physical copy](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1). 

We highly recommend pairing R4DS with the [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). These cheatsheets have been carefully designed to pack a lot of information into a small amount of space. You can keep them handy at your desk and quickly jog your memory when you get stuck. Most of the cheatsheets have been translated into multiple languages.

## DataCamp

DataCamp is an excellent way to improve your R skills, including the tidyverse. A great place to start is the [Tidyverse Fundamentals with R](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/tidyverse-fundamentals) skill track that walks users through many of the packages in the tidyverse in a sequence of five courses. 

Take a look at [all tidyverse courses](https://www.datacamp.com/tidyverse-tutorials?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=213362-c9f98c) or see selected favourites below:

* [Writing functions in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=213362-c9f98c)
  by Hadley and Charlotte Wickham, hosted on DataCamp. This course will teach you the fundamentals 
  of writing functions in R so that, among other things, you can make your code 
  more readable, avoid coding errors, and automate repetitive tasks.

* [Introduction to the tidyverse](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-the-tidyverse?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=213362-c9f98c) by David Robinson, hosted on DataCamp. This is an introduction to the dplyr and ggplot2 packages through exploration and visualization of country data over time. This is a suitable course for people who have no or limited experience in R and are interested in learning to perform data analysis.

* [Data visualisation with ggplot2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=213362-c9f98c) by
  Rick Scavetta, hosted on DataCamp. Covers the basics of ggplot2. Followed by [part 2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-2?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=213362-c9f98c)
  which covers more advanced topics.

* [Exploratory data analysis in R: case study](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-r-case-study?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=213362-c9f98c) by David Robinson, hosted on DataCamp. This course brings ggplot2 and dplyr into action in an in-depth analysis of United Nations voting data. The course also introduces broom for tidying model output and the tidyr package for wrangling data into an explorable shape.

## Workshops

  * [Mastering the Tidyverse](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/courses/22_r-tidyverse) by Jumping Rivers. A one day crash course covering tidyverse fundamentals. The course is a mixture of lectures, short exercises and longer tutorial questions. During the day, we'll cover dplyr, tidy data, tibbles, dates/times and string manipulation.
  * [Introduction to R](https://itsalocke.com/courses/intro-to-r/) by Locke Data. A two day course covering data manipulation and reporting fundamentals using the tidyverse, rmarkdown, and shiny. The course blends lectures, exercises, and practicals over two days to cover the 80% of work that almost everyone needs to do.

## University courses

### 2017

* [Data Challenge Lab](https://dcl-2017-04.github.io/curriculum/upcoming.html).
  Stanford University; Hadley Wickham and Bill Behrman. This is a 5-unit
  course using a flipped classroom. The curriculum is designed to cover
  each main thread of R4DS multiple times, diving a little deeper at
  each pass.
 
* [M.Sc. Industrial Analysis: An International Perspective](https://www.drhector.org/course/m-sc-industrial-analysis-an-international-perspective/). HEC Montreal; Thierry Warin. Graduate program in Data Science for International Business (DS4IB), where students learn how to use RStudio, RMarkdown, the tidyverse and open data in a reproducible research workflow.

* [Better Living with Data Science](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall17/sta112.01/).
  Duke University; Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel. Data Science course for first year undergraduates
  with little to no computing background. Combines techniques from statistics, math, computer 
  science, and social sciences, to learn how to use data to understand natural phenomena, 
  explore patterns, model outcomes, and make predictions. Data wrangling, exploratory data 
  analysis, predictive modeling, data visualization, and effective communication of results. 
  Discussions around reproducibility, data sharing, data privacy.
  
* [Statistical Computing](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/Sta523_Fa17/) Duke University; 
  Colin Rundel. MS level statistical computing course focusing on Best practices and software 
  development for reproducible results, selecting topics from: use of markup languages,

This is an applied course for social scientists with little-to-no programming experience who wish to harness growing digital and computational resources. The focus of the course is on generating reproducible research through the use of programming languages and version control software. Major emphasis is placed on a pragmatic understanding of core principles of programming and packaged implementations of methods. Students will leave the course with basic computational skills implemented through many computational methods and approaches to social science; while students will not become expert programmers, they will gain the knowledge of how to adapt and expand these skills as they are presented with new questions, methods, and data.
