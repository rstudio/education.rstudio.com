# Partner With Us

There's an old saying: "If you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together."
At RStudio, we believe that people go further *and* faster if they go together,
and that the spirit of collaboration that has made open source software, Wikipedia, and Stack Overflow so successful
works just as well for teaching.

To help people on this journey,
we have created an instructor training and certification program.
A day-long online training class introduces modern evidence-based teaching practices, including:

-   learner personas,
-   the differences between novices, competent practitioners, and experts,
-   concept mapping as a way to design lessons,
-   how to use formative assessment to diagnose misunderstandings,
-   cognitive load,
-   live coding as a teaching technique,
-   what motivates and demotivates adult learners,
-   the importance of inclusivity,
-   how to be a good ally, and
-   strategies learners can use to learn more efficiently.

The course is offered online every quarter,
and is followed by two or more exams:
one on teaching,
and one each on technical subjects such as the tidyverse and Shiny
that the instructor wishes to be certified to teach.
Discounts are available for the course and examination fees for people from less affluent regions;
please [get in touch](mailto:greg.wilson@rstudio.com) if you'd like to know more.

Over a hundred people have gone through the course since the program started in January 2019,
and those who have completed certification are now listed in [our trainers' directory](https://rstd.io/trainers).
We consult with our certified trainers regularly to find out how to improve the program
and how to help them teach R, RStudio, and data science more effectively.
