We had a great time at the 2019 rstudio::conf! Many attendees arrived early for 2 days of in-depth workshops, followed by two days of conference sessions. This year's conference featured 15 workshops on tidyverse, Shiny, R Markdown, modeling and machine learning, deep learning, big data, and what they forgot to teach you about working with R. Some of the new workshops for this year touched on topics like putting Shiny applications into production at scale and R & Tensorflow. The conference also featured certification workshops on RStudio Professional Administrator and Train-the-trainer for tidyverse and Shiny.

Below is a list of all workshops we hosted, with links to materials. Even though 
the materials alone cannot replace the actual workshop experience, we hope that you'll find them useful. RStudio regularly hosts workshops throughout the year so please subscribe to [training updates](https://www.rstudio.com/about/subscription-management/). You can also find out more about each of the workshops 
at the [conference repository](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio-conf/blob/master/2019/workshops.md).
