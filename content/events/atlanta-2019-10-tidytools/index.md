If you have experience programming in R and want to learn how to tackle larger scale problems, this workshop is for you. You'll get the most from it if you're already familiar with functions and are comfortable with R's basic data structures (vectors, matrices, arrays, lists, and data frames), and you will:

1. Learn efficient workflows for developing high-quality R functions, using the set of conventions codified by a package. You'll also learn workflows for unit testing, which helps ensure that your functions do exactly what you think they do.  

2. Master the art of writing functions that do one thing well and can be fluently combined together to solve more complex problems. We'll cover common function writing pitfalls and how to avoid them. 

3. Learn how to write collections of functions that work well together, and adhere to existing conventions so they're easy to pick up for newcomers. We'll discuss API design, functional programming tools, the basics of object design in S3, and the tidy eval system for NSE.
