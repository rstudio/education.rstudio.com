<p>Even once you are an expert at R code development, learning some topics in depth will both help you develop better code and share it more effectively with others.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Dive into the foundations of R.</strong> Most R users are not programmers, and therefore much of their R code is not as readable, fast, or efficient as it could be. The second edition of Hadley Wickham’s book, <em>Advanced R</em> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wickham2019advanced">2019</a>)</span> (available for <a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/">free online</a> and as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0815384572/ref=cm_sw_r_tw_dp_U_x_aJ-IDb98S6FE7">an O’Reilly paperback from Amazon</a>), unlocks many of the secrets behind how R works the way it does, and gives you new strategies for solving diverse problems. You may also want to bookmark <a href="https://advanced-r-solutions.rbind.io/"><em>Advanced R Solutions</em></a>, which provides worked solutions to the exercises in this book.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn how to extend R.</strong> While its content sometime overlaps with Hadley’s <em>Advanced R</em>, the R Core Team offers <em>Writing R Extensions</em> (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html">electronic version</a>) on CRAN. This book is particularly useful if you wish to add your own C and C++ routines to R, but also has unique information on debugging, the R API, and runtime profiling that is difficult to find anywhere else.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Build your own packages.</strong> R packages allow you to share your functions with other R programmers in a modular and easy-to-integrate way. The above-mentioned <em>Writing R Extensions</em> documents how to write packages, but you may find Hadley Wickham’s <em>R Packages</em> book <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-wickham2015r">2015</a>)</span> (<a href="http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/">electronic here (1st edition)</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491910593/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=r-pkgs-20">an O’Reilly paperback (1st edition) from Amazon here</a>) a bit easier to read and more step-by-step. The second edition of the <em>R Packages</em> book is currently in progress, written by Hadley and co-author Jenny Bryan. You can read the in-progress book for <a href="https://r-pkgs.org/">free online</a>. If you want your R code to reach the widest possible population of developers, you’ll want to know how to build packages.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use Python in your analyses.</strong> Anyone who insists you must choose between R and Python for doing data science is creating a false choice. R offers an easy way to incorporate Python code in the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate">reticulate package</a>. Sean Lopp’s webinar, <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars/r-rstudio-1-2-amp-python-a-love-story-sean-lopp"><em>R, RStudio 1.2 &amp; Python—a love story</em></a>, demonstrates how easily developers can integrate Python code into their R workflows and walks through the development of a reticulated Shiny app.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Try your hand at Tensorflow for deep learning.</strong> RStudio hosts a web site dedicated to R and Tensorflow at <a href="https://tensorflow.rstudio.com">tensorflow.rstudio.com</a>, where you can learn how to use deep learning in your analyses.
J.J. Allaire and Francois Chollet have published a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-R-Francois-Chollet/dp/161729554X"><em>Deep Learning with R</em> book</a> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-chollet2018deep">2018</a>)</span>. You can hear J.J. describe the philosophy behind the system in his <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/resources/videos/machine-learning-with-tensorflow-and-r/">rstudio::conf 2019 video</a>. For an quick overview of resources for how to get started with deep learning in R, read <a href="https://blog.rstudio.com/2018/09/12/getting-started-with-deep-learning-in-r/">Sigrid Keydana’s article</a> and subscribe to the <a href="https://blogs.rstudio.com/tensorflow/">Tensorflow for R blog</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Communicate with R Markdown.</strong> The R Markdown family of packages enables you to create and share beautiful data science products like books, blogs, websites, and presentations. Experiment with packages like <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/">bookdown</a>, <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/distill/">distill</a>, and <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">blogdown</a>; each extends R Markdown to help you publish polished websites for sharing your work. If you want to present analyses or visualizations made with R code, consider making your slides with R Markdown using the <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html">xaringan package</a>. If you’ve built an R package, the <a href="https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/">pkgdown</a> package makes it quick and relatively painless to build a website for your package, using all the work you’ve already done to write and document your functions.</p></li>
