Sarah enjoys helping companies ensure that their internal & external information is both findable and usable. As a librarian, she has worked for universities, a law firm and a start-up, ensuring that staff & clients are able to get the right information when they need it.If there's a mess that needs to be organized, she's the person to call! While she currently resides outside Sacramento, Sarah is a recent transplant to Northern California.She spent 15 years in Chicago, receiving her undergraduate degree from the University of Chicago and her Master's in Library & Information Science from the University of Illinois. When she's not ignoring everyone in favor of a good book, she can be found spending time with her husband and 2 young kids, knitting, or enjoying the California sunshine.
