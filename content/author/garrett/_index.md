Garrett is the author of [_Hands-On Programming with R_](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) and co-author of [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [_R Markdown: The Definitive Guide_](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). He is a Data Scientist at RStudio and holds a Ph.D. in Statistics, but specializes in teaching.  He has designed RStudio's training materials for [R](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers), [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/#video-tutorials), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) and more; and has taught at dozens of conferences, government agencies, and multi-billion dollar global companies. Garrett wrote the popular lubridate package for dates and times in R and creates the [RStudio cheat sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). If you use R yourself, you may recognize Garrett from his video courses for O'Reilly Media and (formerly) DataCamp.
