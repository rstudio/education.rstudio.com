# Teaching A New Generation of R Users
R's popularity has risen in parallel with the dramatic increase in demand for data scientists and statisticians.
That phenomenon in turn has fueled a booming market for those who can teach R to others.
RStudio's mission is to equip everyone, regardless of means, to participate in a global economy that rewards data literacy.
