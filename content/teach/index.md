# Teaching A New Generation of R Users

R's popularity has risen in parallel with the dramatic increase in demand for data scientists and statisticians. That phenomenon in turn has fueled a booming market for those who can teach R to others. As part of RStudio's mission to equip everyone, regardless of means, to participate in a global economy that rewards data literacy, we not only offer resources for learners, but also for teachers. The following resources are aimed at those who teach R. Some are designed specifically for academic teaching in a semester-long format and others for much shorter workshops.

## Learning to teach

- [**Deep Teaching**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/deep-teaching): You've put deep learning on your to-do list, but how about deep teaching? This one day workshop introduces education best practices to programmers and data scientists. The workshop covers topics such as how the differences between novices, competent practitioners, and experts affect what and how you teach; using formative assessment to keep teaching on track in real time; what cognitive load is and how to design lessons that take it into account; how to use slides effectively; teaching as a performance art; and what motivates and demotivates adult learners.

- [**Instructor training and certification**](https://rstudio-trainers.netlify.com/): In 2019, RStudio has launched an instructor training and certification program that aims to help people apply modern evidence-based teaching practices to teach data science using R and RStudioâ€™s products, and to help people who need such training find the trainers they need. You can m our Certified Trainers and find out more about the program and the application process [here](https://rstudio-trainers.netlify.com/), and access our Instructor Training Materials [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY).

  
## Teaching materials

### Semester-long courses

- [**Data Science in a Box**](https://datasciencebox.org): Data Science in a Box contains the materials for teaching a semester-long introductory data science course. The "box" contains materials for an undergraduate level introductory data science course, such as slide decks, homework assignments, guided labs, sample exams, a final project assignment, as well as materials for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and course logistics. The [website](https://datasciencebox.org) exposes the source materials that live in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box) and use datasets from the [dsbox package](https://github.com/rstudio-education/dsbox).

- [**STAT 545 - Reboot**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/stat545-reboot): STAT 545 is the legendary course taught by Jenny Bryan while she was teaching full-time at UBC. This is a graduate level course focuses on exploring, grooming, visualizing, and analyzing data, and making  all of that reproducible, reusable, and share-able using R. Jenny has always made resources for her course openly available, and this project is a reboot of the resources in bookdown format with updated data and syntax to ensure longevity and contemporary best practices. 

### Workshops

#### Tidyverse

- [**R for Data Science Instructor's Guide**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/r4ds-instructors): This repository contains noted for people teaching [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) with each chapter's learning objectives and key points.
- [**Instructor materials for teaching Master the Tidyverse**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/master-the-tidyverse-instructors): [Master the Tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio-education/master-the-tidyverse/) is an award-winning two-day workshop which attempts to provide a gentle introduction to doing data science with the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). This repository contains instructor materials (Keynote and PowerPoint slides) for teaching this workshop.

#### Shiny

- [Teach Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio-education/teach-shiny): This workshop is designed for those who want to up their teaching Shiny game, and is particularly aimed at training partners who want to qualify as an RStudio Certified Shiny Instructor and at those who are R and Shiny advocates in their organizations.

#### Plethora of other workshop materials!

At the [RStudio Education GitHub Organization](https://github.com/rstudio-education/) instructors can find the materials for all workshops taught by the RStudio Education team. All of these workshop materials are openly-licensed and freely-available for reuse. Please follow the reuse guidelines outlined in the licenses in the specific repositories, and enjoy leveraging quality teaching materials designed and developed by our team!


## Computing infrastructure

- [**RStudio Cloud in the Classroom**](https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars/rstudio-cloud-in-the-classroom): A common friction point for getting students (and faculty) started with computing is installation and setup. Circumventing the installation step early in the course by having students access R and RStudio in the cloud can minimize frustration and improve buy in. RStudio Cloud is a lightweight and easy to set up / use solution to this problem. This webinar walks you through the steps of setting up your course on RStudio Cloud, highlighting the various functionalities for teachers and students.

- [Infrastructure and tools for teaching computing throughout the statistical curriculum](https://peerj.com/preprints/3181/): Much has been written in the statistics education literature about pedagogical tools and approaches to provide a practical computational foundation for students. This article discusses the computational infrastructure and toolkit choices to allow for these pedagogical innovations using RStudio Server and RStudio Server Pro, while minimizing frustration and improving adoption for both our students and instructors. The article includes links to technical notes on setting up these systems for teaching, intended for both academics and IT professionals.
