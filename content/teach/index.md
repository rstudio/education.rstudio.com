# Teaching A New Generation of R Users

RStudio's mission to equip everyone, regardless of means, to participate in a global economy that rewards data literacy. RStudio's education team supports that mission with open-source educational materials that we believe will help train the next million R users around the world. 

However, we cannot do this alone; we also need teachers. R's popularity has fueled a booming market for those who can teach R to others. The following resources are aimed at those people. Some are designed specifically for academic teaching in a semester-long format and others for much shorter workshops. All of RStudio's resources are distributed under open-source licenses to encourage teachers to adapt and use these materials in their own ways.

Teaching R breaks down into two separable and learnable skills:

1. General teaching skills
2. How to use those skills to teach R and data science.

We'll tackle these two topics independently.

## Learning to teach

While it might seem like teaching data science is a new activity, educational professionals have studied teaching techniques for decades. Today's teaching techniques are based not only on the personal experiences of classroom teachers, but also on neuroscience and cognitive psychology. While we can't replicate the thoroughness of the National Academies of Sciences,Engineering, and Medicine's [How People Learn](https://www.amazon.com/How-People-Learn-II-Learners/dp/0309459648/), we can recommend a couple of starting points for learning how to teach technology:

- **Read [Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech).** RStudio's Greg Wilson penned (actually, he typed it) this book as part of his work at [the Carpentries](http://thecarpentries.org). The book will help you to create and deliver lessons that work for technical and non-technical audiences alike and to build a teaching community around them.

- **Start [deep teaching](https://github.com/rstudio-education/deep-teaching).** You've put deep learning on your to-do list, but how about deep teaching? This [one-day workshop](https://github.com/rstudio-education/deep-teaching) introduces education best practices to programmers and data scientists. The workshop covers topics such as how the differences between novices, competent practitioners, and experts affect what and how you teach; using formative assessment to keep teaching on track in real time; what cognitive load is and how to design lessons that take it into account; how to use slides effectively; teaching as a performance art; and what motivates and demotivates adult learners.

- **Become a [certified trainer](https://rstd.io/trainers).** In 2019, RStudio has launched an instructor training and certification program that aims to help people apply modern evidence-based teaching practices to teach data science using R and RStudio’s products, and to help people who need such training find the trainers they need. You can meet our Certified Trainers and find out more about the program and the application process [here](https://rstd.io/trainers), and access our Instructor Training Materials [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY).
  
## Teaching materials

RStudio offers several resources to make it easier for you to teach R, ranging from courses to workshops to computing infrastructure.

### Courses

Most teachers enjoy developing their own instruction materials, but the need for exercises, homework, exams, slides, and other supporting materials make this a big job. Below are some open source materials developed at RStudio and elsewhere that you can freely adapt and use for your R teaching.

- **Get a complete [data science course in a box](https://datasciencebox.org).** [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org) contains the complete materials for teaching a semester-long introductory data science course. The "box" contains materials for an undergraduate level introductory data science course, such as slide decks, homework assignments, guided labs, sample exams, a final project assignment, as well as materials for instructors such as pedagogical tips, information on computing infrastructure, technology stack, and course logistics. The [website](https://datasciencebox.org) exposes the source materials that live in a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box) and use datasets from the [dsbox package](https://github.com/rstudio-education/dsbox).

- **Teach with [STAT 545](https://stat545-book.netlify.com/).**
Stat545 is a course in data wrangling, analysis, and exploration in R with RStudio. Although the course was designed as a graduate-level, semester-long introduction to data science by [Dr. Jennifer (Jenny) Bryan](https://jennybryan.org/), the free online materials Jenny developed have been a valuable resource for self-directed learners and other educators. The education team at RStudio has recently refreshed the course materials into an online book.

- **Use [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) in the classroom.** Many educators use the free online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) as a course textbook. There is also an [R for Data Science Instructor's Guide](https://github.com/rstudio-education/r4ds-instructors), which contains notes for people teaching [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) with each chapter's learning objectives and key points. The "unofficial" [R4DS Solutions Manual](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/), a community resource developed by and for educators, is also helpful if you want to use R4DS in the classroom.

### Workshop Materials

Many of you may have taken workshops from the RStudio team, but did you know that all of RStudio's workshop materials are available for you to use in your own workshops? Below are a few of the more popular workshop respositories proven popular with teachers:
  
- [**Teach the Tidyverse.**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/master-the-tidyverse-instructors) [Master the Tidyverse](https://github.com/rstudio-education/master-the-tidyverse/) is an award-winning two-day introduction to doing data science with the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). This repository contains instructor materials (Keynote and PowerPoint slides) for teaching this workshop.

- [**Teach Shiny.**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/teach-shiny) This workshop is designed for those who want to up their teaching Shiny game, and is particularly aimed at training partners who want to qualify as an RStudio Certified Shiny Instructor and at those who are R and Shiny advocates in their organizations.

- [**Teach everything else!**](https://github.com/rstudio-education/) At the [RStudio Education GitHub Organization](https://github.com/rstudio-education/) instructors can find the materials for all workshops taught by the RStudio Education team. All of these workshop materials are openly-licensed and freely-available for reuse. Please follow the reuse guidelines outlined in the licenses in the specific repositories, and enjoy leveraging quality teaching materials designed and developed by our team!


## Computing infrastructure

A common friction point for getting students (and faculty) started with computing is installation and setup. Having the right computing infrastructure set up for either a workshop or a course can help minimize frustration and improve buy in for both students and instructors.

- **[Sign up for RStudio Academic pricing](https://rstudio-com.netlify.com/pricing/academic-pricing/).** RStudio offers special academic pricing discounts for our commercial products to qualified academic institutions. To find out if you qualify, please read more [here](https://rstudio-com.netlify.com/pricing/academic-pricing/). To get academic pricing, [contact the RStudio Sales team](https://www.rstudio.com/about/contact-sales/).

- **Use [RStudio Cloud in the Classroom](https://resources.rstudio.com/webinars/rstudio-cloud-in-the-classroom).** [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) is a managed cloud instance of the RStudio IDE. This means you and your learners can use the RStudio IDE directly from your browser - there is no software to install and nothing to configure on your computer. Using RStudio Cloud early in a workshop or course allows you to circumvent the installation step and skip right to the good stuff. This webinar walks you through the steps of setting up your course on RStudio Cloud, highlighting the various functionalities for teachers and students.

- **Craft your course infrastructure.** The article [_Infrastructure and tools for teaching computing throughout the statistical curriculum_](https://peerj.com/preprints/3181/) discusses computational infrastructure and toolkit choices for modern educators using RStudio Server and RStudio Server Pro. The authors provide links to technical notes on setting up these systems for teaching, intended for both academics and IT professionals. (Note: A peer reviewed, but pay-walled version of the article can be found [here](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1397549).)
