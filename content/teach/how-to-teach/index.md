While it might seem like teaching data science is a new activity, educational professionals have studied teaching techniques for decades. Today's teaching techniques are based not only on the personal experiences of classroom teachers, but also on neuroscience and cognitive psychology. While we can't replicate the thoroughness of the National Academies's [_How People Learn_](https://www.amazon.com/How-People-Learn-II-Learners/dp/0309459648/), we can recommend a couple of starting points for learning how to teach technology:

- **Read [_Teaching Tech Together_](http://teachtogether.tech).** RStudio's [Greg Wilson](authors/greg) penned (actually, he typed it) this book based on his work for [the Carpentries](http://carpentries.org), and it will help you create and deliver lessons that work for technical and non-technical audiences alike and to build a teaching community around them.

- **Get involved in [the Carpentries](http://carpentries.org)**, a volunteer organization that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide (they've even run a workshop in Antarctica). Their lessons on [data wrangling](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/), [programming](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/), and [for librarians](https://librarycarpentry.org/lessons/) are all open access and classroom-tested.

- **Become a [certified trainer](https://rstd.io/trainers).** In 2019, RStudio has launched an instructor training and certification program that aims to help people apply modern evidence-based teaching practices to teach data science using R and RStudioâ€™s products, and to help people who need such training find the trainers they need. You can meet our Certified Trainers and find out more about the program and the application process [here](https://rstd.io/trainers), and access our Instructor Training Materials [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY).
