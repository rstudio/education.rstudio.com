While it might seem like teaching data science is a new activity, educational professionals have studied teaching techniques for decades. Today's teaching techniques are based not only on the personal experiences of classroom teachers, but also on neuroscience and cognitive psychology. While we can't replicate the thoroughness of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine's [How People Learn](https://www.amazon.com/How-People-Learn-II-Learners/dp/0309459648/), we can recommend a couple of starting points for learning how to teach technology:

- **Read [_Teaching Tech Together_](http://teachtogether.tech).** RStudio's [Greg Wilson](authors/greg) penned (actually, he typed it) this book as part of his work at [the Carpentries](http://thecarpentries.org). The book will help you to create and deliver lessons that work for technical and non-technical audiences alike and to build a teaching community around them.

- **Start [deep teaching](https://github.com/rstudio-education/deep-teaching).** You've put deep learning on your to-do list, but how about deep teaching? This [one-day workshop](https://github.com/rstudio-education/deep-teaching) introduces education best practices to programmers and data scientists. The workshop covers topics such as how the differences between novices, competent practitioners, and experts affect what and how you teach; using formative assessment to keep teaching on track in real time; what cognitive load is and how to design lessons that take it into account; how to use slides effectively; teaching as a performance art; and what motivates and demotivates adult learners.

- **Become a [certified trainer](https://rstd.io/trainers).** In 2019, RStudio has launched an instructor training and certification program that aims to help people apply modern evidence-based teaching practices to teach data science using R and RStudio’s products, and to help people who need such training find the trainers they need. You can meet our Certified Trainers and find out more about the program and the application process [here](https://rstd.io/trainers), and access our Instructor Training Materials [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13ohFt3D0EJ5PDbMaWTxnHH-hwA7G0IvY).
