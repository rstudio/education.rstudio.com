Over two dozen people are now certified instructors and listed in our [trainers' directory](https://rstd.io/trainers), and more are in the pipeline.
The first step in joining them is to take part in one of our upcoming online classes:

-   Sept 16-17 for people in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
-   Sept 25-26 for people in the Americas

The course runs 4 hours each day (i.e., two back-to-back half-days);
the materials are [available online][slides],
and we are also offering the course at [rstudio::conf 2020][conf] in January.
After completing the course,
participants must do one exam on teaching
and one each on the technical topics (tidyverse and/or Shiny).
If you would like to take part,
please fill in [this form][form] to tell us about yourself
or mail [Greg Wilson](mailto:greg.wilson@rstudio.com) if you have questions.
