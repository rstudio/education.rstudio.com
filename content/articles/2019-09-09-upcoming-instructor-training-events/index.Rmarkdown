Over two dozen people are now certified instructors and listed in our [trainers' directory](https://rstd.io/trainers),
and more are in the pipeline.
If you would like to join them,
the first step is to take part in one of our upcoming training classes.
Both the Sept 16-17 class (for people in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa)
and the Sept 25-26 (for people in the Americas) are now full,
but more will be scheduled in November,
and we still have some space in the class that will be run at [rstudio::conf 2020][conf] in January.

The course runs 4 hours each day (i.e., two back-to-back half-days);
the materials are [available online][slides],
and a book-length version is [also available][t3].
After completing the course,
participants must do one exam on teaching
and one each on the technical topics (tidyverse and/or Shiny).
If you would like to take part,
please fill in [this form][form] to tell us about yourself
or mail [Greg Wilson](mailto:greg.wilson@rstudio.com) if you have questions.
