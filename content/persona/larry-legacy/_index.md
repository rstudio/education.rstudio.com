name: "Larry Legacy"
---

1. Larry got a job with a pharmaceutical company the day after he graduated and
   has been with them through two mergers and an acquisition. He refers to
   company officers by their first names, and is always happy to explain what
   they're doing wrong. He was offered the chance to go to rstudio::conf last
   year, but gave the spot to one of his younger colleagues because "they'd
   probably enjoy it more".

2. Larry has been using SAS for 25 years and regards it as a perfectly fine
   tool, thank you very much.

3. Larry has never used R, but has decades of experience with statistics, messy
   data, and reporting. He prefers very structured learning environments and
   clear objectives, and his most common question, "How would Iâ€¦" followed by a
   summary of something he has been doing for years in SAS.

4. Larry is a reluctant learner: he recognizes that he has to learn R now that
   management has decided to adopt Shiny for all its reporting tools, but with
   just eight years to go until early retirement, the thought makes him
   weary. He is very uncomfortable with anything outside his normal working
   environment: he needs to see how to use an IDE step by step (preferably in a
   one-on-one tutorial) to get over his paralysis.

## Needs

Larry finds tutorials long-winded ("Just show me what function I need to call!")
or confusing ("Why would they do it that way?"). Cheatsheets showing him how to
map his understanding of SAS to equivalent code in R would be his preferred
starting point.
