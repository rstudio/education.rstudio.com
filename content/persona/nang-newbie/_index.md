name: "Nang Newbie"
---

1. Nang is 18 years old and in the first year of an undergraduate degree in
   urban planning. He's read lots of gushing articles about data science, and
   was excited by the prospect of learning how to do it, but dropped his CS 101
   course after six weeks because nothing made sense. He's doing better in Anya
   Academic's course (which he is taking as an elective), but still spends most
   of his time copying, pasting, and swearing.

2. Nang did well in his high school math classes, and built himself a home page
   with HTML and CSS in a weekend workshop in grade 11. He has accounts on nine
   different social media site, and attends all of his morning classes online.

3. Nang wants self-paced tutorials with practice exercises, plus forums where he
   can ask for help.

4. Nang is reluctant to reveal his ignoranceâ€”he would rather get a low grade and
   blame it on partying than let his classmates see that he's floundering.

## Needs

Nang needs short overviews to orient him and introductory tutorials that include
videos or animated GIFs showing exactly how to drive the tools, and that use
datasets he can relate to.
