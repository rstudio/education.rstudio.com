name: "Anya Academic"

1. Anya, a professor of neuropsychology, studies color perception in
   infants. She is also responsible for teaching an introduction to statistics
   to 1100 first-year students every year. (Students complain that the Stats
   department's introductory course is too theoretical and requires more
   programming knowledge than they have.)

2. Anya runs several experiments on 50â€“100 infant subjects each year. She used
   to analyze the results with SPSS, but is switching to R (which she taught
   herself during a sabbatical). She has never taken a programming course, and
   suffers from impostor syndrome in discussions about things like GitHub and R
   Markdown.

3. Anya would like to learn more about time series analysis to support her
   research, and about tools like Git and R Markdown. She also wants guidance
   using R to teach her intro stats course, which currently uses a mixture of
   Excel and SPSS.

4. Anya is juggling half a dozen responsibilities at work, and doesn't want to
   look uninformed in front of her colleagues and students.

## Needs

Anya needs workshops (so that she can allocate focused time) and how-to guides
(for her research). She would like ready-to-use lesson material she could remix
for her students and some orientation material to demystify jargon (what the
hell is a "pull request"?). Finally, it's important that she be able to use the
same tools in her research as in her teaching in order to amortize learning
costs and stay in practice.
