name: "Katrin Keener"
---

1. Katrin did a Master's in neuropsychology and a 12-week bootcamp with Insight
   Data Science before getting a job analyzing logistics for a health care
   services company. She has a wide range of interests and loves learning new
   things.

2. Katrin uses R, Python, and SQL daily, and recently talked one of the IT staff
   into teaching her Docker. She has done several online mini-courses in machine
   learning.

3. Katrin wants to level up her understanding of just about everything. She
   needs cookbooks and worked examples to show her how to accomplish specific
   tasks or to fill in specific gaps in her knowledge.

4. While she is enjoying her new job, Katrin misses the camaraderie of grad
   school and her Insight fellowship: she prefers learning with others to
   studying on her own. She recently found out about R-Ladies and has enjoyed
   the two meetups she has been to.

## Needs

Katrin wants workshops (as an opportunity to meet people) and self-paced lessons
(so that she can learn new things on her own). She has a complete set of
cheatsheets taped up on her wall, but usually checks Stack Overflow before
looking at reference manuals.
