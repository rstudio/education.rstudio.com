name: "M'shelle Manager"
---

1. A programmer who moved into customer support and then into product
   management, M'shelle is now in charge of a ten-person analytics group. She is
   responsible for getting her team trained and purchasing the tools they need
   to do their work.

2. M'shelle thinks in Java; she used base R to develop models and generate
   reports several years ago, but was promoted before the tidyverse became
   popular.

3. M'shelle wants to improve her team's processes, particularly around packaging
   code and making work more reproducible. The new VP of engineering has also
   asked her to turn everything into a web service. While all of this is going
   on, she needs to decide how much budget she needs for new software that she
   will personally never use.

4. M'shelle has to work within a strict training budget, and it can sometimes
   take months to get approval for off-site training (and even longer for
   on-site).

## Needs

M'shelle needs tutorials, reference material, and how-to guides for everything
that isn't data science, including testing, packaging, and Shiny. (Her team is
satisfied with the existing tutorials on data manipulation and modeling.)
