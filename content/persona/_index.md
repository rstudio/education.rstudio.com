title: "RStudio Learner Personas"
---

A [learner persona][personas] is a short description of a typical learner. By
personalizing learners, personas help instructors figure out who they’re trying
to help and communicate that understanding to each other and to learners. Each
persona has general background, relevant prior knowledge or experience, the
learner’s perception of their needs, and any special considerations.

Any workshop, tutorial, how-to guide, or reference manual should be designed for
1–3 specific personas.  The personas below have been synthesized from ones
created by RStudio staff and certified instructors; improvements and additions
very welcome.

## Notes

1.  A *novice* is someone who doesn't yet have a mental model of some field: as
    a result, they don't know what they don't know.  Someone is *competent* if
    they know enough to perform routine tasks without heroic effort, while they
    are an *expert* if they are able to solve common problems at a glance and
    harder or more unusual problems reliably.

2.  The domains in these personas (such as pharmacy or event management) are
    meant to be placeholders: swap in another domain such as finance or
    logistics as desired.
