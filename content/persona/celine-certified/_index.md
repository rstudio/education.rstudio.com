name: "Celine Certified"

1. Celine has an MBA in finance and is now a certified RStudio instructor
   working for a full service solution provider. She spends her time developing
   new training material in airports and delivering them between flights.

2. R is the only language Celine has ever learned well, but she has learned it
   very well. She is proficient with a variety of packages for modeling and time
   series analysis, and knows more than any sane person should about extracting
   data from Excel. She regularly contributes small fixes to a dozen of the
   packages she teaches most often, and tries to answer one Stack Overflow
   question every working day.

3. Celine is always interested in seeing other people's teaching material, but
   what she appreciates most is up-to-date examples she can recycle and build
   her own lessons around.

4. Celine is sometimes frustrated by how little developers think about the
   learnability or usability of their packages, and wishes she had more control
   over what she's going to be asked to teach.

## Needs

Celine needs vignettes, worked examples, and cookbooks that she can mine to
create training to meet her audience's needs. She would also like pointers to
material on better teaching practices.
