name: "Jacqui Ofalltrades"

1. Jacqui works for a three-person consulting company that does everything from
   training to installation and administration to building dashboards for
   clients. She is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese as well as English, and much
   of her business is with Latin American firms.

2. Jacqui has been using Python and Pandas for several years, and just finished
   working through R for Data Science for the second time in preparation for
   teaching the tidyverse. She has built a couple of Shiny dashboards for
   clients, and hopes to get a package accepted by CRAN some day.

3. Jacqui wants updates on what's new in RStudio products and related data
   science packages and tools, and advanced guides for making Shiny faster,
   integrated with no-SQL databases, and other high-value topics. She finds most
   self-paced tutorials frustrating because they're answering questions she
   doesn't have today.

4. Jacqui believes that time is money: every minute she spends learning
   something new has to pay off sooner rather than later.

## Needs

Jacqui wants how-to guides and reference material for her day-to-day work,
webinars to give her a sense of where the industry is going, and short,
intensive online training for very specific topics.
