name: "Toshi Techsupport"
---

1. Toshi does internal tech support in a company with 500 staff. While others on
   his team take care of resetting passwords, he debugs setup issues and figures
   out why the dashboard is displaying nonsense. (It's usually something to do
   with date formatting.) He often winds up writing bits of code from Stack
   Overflow to glue things together.

2. Toshi speaks Perl, Python, and JavaScript, but hardly any R. He switches back
   and forth between Linux, Windows, and Mac every day. He often finds himself
   running hour-long internal training seminars, and would now like to learn
   some data science to support his users and out of personal interest. He
   wishes people would take a few hours and learn more about the software
   they're using, but in practice, he often only has a 30-minute call in which
   to diagnose the problem and explain a solution.

3. A growing number of analysts inside Toshi's company use R Markdown to prepare
   parameterized reports. Some are also using flexdashboard and Shiny, so he
   would like to learn enough about them to be useful.

4. Toshi lives in Hawaii, so most of his work is done remotely.

## Needs

Toshi needs examples and reference material for himself that he can paraphrase
for the people he is supportingâ€”he knows most of what they cover, but needs
something bite-sized for others to consume. He also needs tutorials he can remix
for hour-long internal training webinars.
