## [Get Started with tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/)

We recently launched the new [tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org/) website, and one of the standout learning resources in there (in my humble opinion) is the *[Get Started](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/)* section. This section features five articles, starting with how to create a model and ending with a beginning-to-end modeling case study. While not fully interactive (yet!), you can copy/paste the code to work through the materials locally. Be on the lookout for integrations with [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) tutorials that will [work within the IDE](https://blog.rstudio.com/2020/02/25/rstudio-1-3-integrated-tutorials/) after our summer intern, [Ezgi Karaesman](/blog/2020/04/announcing-2020-interns/), works her education magic `r emo::ji("dizzy")`

## [Advanced Statistical Computing with R](https://cal-poly-advanced-r.github.io/STAT-431/)

These are the materials for a Spring 2020 undergraduate course offered by two wonderful professors at [California Polytechnic State University](https://www.calpoly.edu/), Drs. [Kelly Bodwin](https://www.kelly-bodwin.com/) and [Hunter Glanz](https://twitter.com/hglanz?lang=en). Here is their course description:

> "Advanced techniques for efficient use of computers to perform statistical computations and to analyze large amounts of data. Includes version control systems; tools supporting reproducibility; functional programming; randomization and bootstrapping; dynamic data visualizations; and R package development."

Follow along with their learners using this [course schedule](https://cal-poly-advanced-r.github.io/STAT-431/#section-4). Week-by-week, Drs. G & B provide a curated sequence of readings, videos, and small practice activities with careful time estimates so you know what you are signing up for.

Each week also features a lab assignment and extra challenges so you can practice if you have the time.

## [Ready for R](https://ready4r.netlify.app/)

## [Data science with R: A robust toolkit for psychological research](http://robust-tools.djnavarro.net/)

This course is created and taught by [Dr. Danielle Navarro](https://djnavarro.net/), an Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales and an [RStudio certified trainer](https://education.rstudio.com/trainers/people/navarro+danielle/). Danielle is also a co-author on the work-in-progress 3rd edition of the book *["ggplot2: elegant graphics for data analysis"](https://ggplot2-book.org/)""*

## [Data Visualization](https://datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com/)

![Data Visualization by Dr. Andrew Heiss](heiss-dataviz.png "Data Visualization by Dr. Andrew Heiss"){width="100"}

Created by [Professor Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com/), also an RStudio certified trainer, this website is an asynchronous online course --- with hours of video, interactive code, code examples, and all sorts of neat stuff! From Andrew's course description:

> "Use R, ggplot2, and the principles of graphic design to create beautiful and truthful visualizations of data"

All materials are open source and creative commons licensed, so anyone can adapt and improve it later!

A personal aside: this beautiful website is built using the Hugo Academic theme with the R blogdown package. You can see the source code for the website on [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewheiss/datavizm20.classes.andrewheiss.com). Andrew's website is [another great example](https://share-blogdown.netlify.app/) of a course website that was [shared on short notice](rstd.io/sharing)!

## [Supervised Machine Learning Case Studies with R](https://supervised-ml-course.netlify.app/)

This course is *newly* updated to use the tidymodels framework for predictive modeling, brought to you by [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/). Julia may not need an introduction, but I'll do one anyway: she a member of the tidymodels software engineering team here at RStudio. When I first started my own [machine learning journey](https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-12-23-learning-to-teach-machines-to-learn/), Julia's course was a welcome break for me from predicting home prices in [Ames, Iowa](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/AmesHousing/index.html)! Julia brings her unique real-world practical experience as a data scientist, and her talent for explaining complicated things in simple terms is a breath of fresh air. I was lucky enough to get a preview of this revised version, and wholeheartedly recommend this course to a wide range of learners, including those who are new to machine learning and experienced machine learning practitioners who want to learn how to use tidymodels to do the things you were already doing in caret or other machine learning packages.
