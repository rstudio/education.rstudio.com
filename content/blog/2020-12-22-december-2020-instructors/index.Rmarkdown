This brings the total number of certified Tidyverse instructors to 186

and the number certified for Shiny to 33.
If you would like to speak with any of them about your training needs,
their contact information is on the [trainers' roster](http://education.rstudio.com/trainers)
and they would be happy to hear from you.

It has been a difficult year,
and as it ends,
many of us will be thinking of family, friends, and colleagues who are no longer with us.
We hope you and yours are safe and well,
and we wish you the best for 2021.
