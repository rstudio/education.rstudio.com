  Want to apply to this year's summer intern program? Here's how.
---

As [we announced last year][preview],
RStudio's summer intern program will run for a third time in 2020,
and applications are now open.
Five people will work with an RStudio mentor full-time for 10 weeks starting in May 2020.
Everyone is welcome to apply:
you do not need to be a a full-time student to be eligible for an internship.

The compensation rate for these positions is $25/hr,
assuming 40 hours each week;
applicants must be residents of,
and able to accept employment in,
the United States.
Since RStudio is a geographically distributed team,
you can be based anywhere in the country:
unless you live in Boston or Seattle,
you will be working 100% remotely,
though you will meet with your mentor regularly online.

## How to Apply

The closing date for applications is midnight on Friday, March 6 AOE (Anywhere on Earth),
and we will interview and make offers as quickly as possible thereafter.

## Projects

This year's internships will be divided between our open source and education teams,
and the projects will be selected from:

1.  **Create resources for people working with spreadsheets in R**.
    Develop content that does for spreadsheets
    what sites like [db.rstudio.com](https://db.rstudio.com/)
    and [environments.rstudio.com](https://environments.rstudio.com/)
    do for databases and reproducible environments, respectively.
    Primary tasks will include writing, synthesis, comparison, exposition, and exampling.
    This project is not explicitly about package development,
    although the work could easily lead to pull requests to spreadsheet reading/writing packages.
    Candidates should show evidence of general R experience,
    basic competence with Git/GitHub,
    previous use of R Markdown,
    and ability to write clearly about code.
    Supervisors: [Jenny Bryan][bryan-jenny] and [Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel][cetinkaya-rundel-mine].

1.  **Build interactive [learnr][learnr] tutorials for [tidymodels][tidymodels]**
    based on our existing introductory [tidymodels workshop][tidymodels-intro] materials.
    Candidates should show evidence of having used R for data analysis and/or statistical modeling
    as well as basic competence with Git and GitHub; experience using the [learnr][learnr] package is a plus.
    Supervisor: [Alison Hill][hill-alison].

1.  **Build interactive [learnr][learnr] tutorials for Python using [reticulate][reticulate].**
    These would mirror the content of our existing [tidyverse primers][primers].
    Candidates should be comfortable using R or Python for data science
    and have basic competence with Git and GitHub;
    experience using the [learnr][learnr] package is a plus.
    Supervisors: [Alison Hill][hill-alison] and [Greg Wilson][wilson-greg].

1.  **[Tidymodels][tidymodels] package support.**
    This intern will work on the support and development of modeling packages, primarily [broom][broom],
    which provides a large number of methods to turn models into tidy data frames.
    The work will include internal refactoring,
    revisit the testing strategy,
    and further develop the `augment` method.
    Candidates should understand R packages, S3 methods, and unit testing, and be comfortable using Git and GitHub.
    Supervisor: [Max Kuhn][kuhn-max].

1.  **Tree and rule-based models.**
    The [Cubist][cubist] and [C50][c50] packages contain large amounts of C code to train ensemble models.
    This intern will improve their sustainability and add new features
    such as variable importance, efficiency, and cost-sensitive models.
    Candidates should understand R packages work,
    have solid C skills and some experience with modeling,
    and be comfortable using Git and GitHub.
    Supervisor: [Max Kuhn][kuhn-max].
