## Components to teach xaringan

### Must-haves (~1 hr)
- remark.js = JavaScript + Markdown
- xaringan = remark.js + Rmd
- YAML
  - How is the output different from a more common one like `html_document`?
- Slide structure
  - `{r setup}` chunk
  - `---` to start first slide and separate new ones
  - `class:`
- Slide preview
  - With Knit button or `xaringan::infinite_moon_reader()` (or `xaringan::inf_mr()`)
- What's familiar from Markdown vs. new from remark.js
  - Headings are familiar
  - `![]` is familiar
  - Making bullet points is familiar (`*`, `-`, `+`)
  - `---` is not familiar
  - `--` is not familiar
  - `???` is not familiar
- Placement of content
  - Align entire slide
  - Align some content
  - `.pull-left[]` and `.pull-right[]`
  - `.left-column[]` and `.right-column[]`
  - `.footnote[]`, particularly for academic audience
- Adding pictures
  - Markdown `![]`
  - `knitr::include_graphics()`
  - Recommended image path
  - Examples of background size (e.g. cover, contain)
- R content
  - Tables (e.g. direct output, HTML, DT, gt)
  - Plots (e.g issue with sizing and how to fix)
- Presenting
  - Presenter view
  - Presenter notes (i.e. `???`)
  - Full-screen (F key)
  - Clone screen (C key) (in the context of a dual-monitor setup)

### Nice-to-haves (~1.5 hrs)
- CSS styles the slides
  - I would maybe consider this a must-have if you're explicitly using a template and need to let the audience briefly know what it is and what it's doing
- Adding pictures
  - HTML
  - Examples of background position (e.g. 90% 50%)
- R content
  - plots (e.g. side-by-side)
- Sharing slides
  - `self_contained: TRUE` in YAML + Knit

### If there's extra time (2 hrs)
- Slide structure
  - `name:`
  - `template:`
  - the hiding slides feature that I'm forgetting
- Icons
  - emojis from `emo::ji()`
  - icons from Fontawesome
  - icons from Academicons
- Presenting
  - Presentation timer
- Sharing slides
  - GitHub pages
  - Netlify
