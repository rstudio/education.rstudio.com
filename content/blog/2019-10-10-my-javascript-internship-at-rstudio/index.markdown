It's funny to admit, but I applied for the RStudio internship because I wanted to learn JavaScript. I was recieving my Masters in Botany and found myself programstinating, a term I just made up for making plots and Shiny Apps from personal data instead of extracting DNA or writing my manuscript.

But programming was only a byproduct of my Master's work and I began to realize if I wanted to identify as a programmer, I needed a more wholistic understanding beyond the packages and functions I needed only for my Masters work.

Enter the [TidyBlocks](tidyblocks.tech) project. I remember in my interview telling Greg Wilson my primary goal for the summer: to know more about JavaScript. When applying, I felt comfortable with the JavaScript version of the first chapter of any R programming book: arrays, lists, strings, and basic operations. I also had created some d3.js visualizations by frankenstein-ing open source code snippets together. I was reading a lot about coding but hadn't written much. I certainly never started a project from nothing.

Starting a project in a language you don't know sounds daunting, but TidyBlocks hit the failure sweet spot. Failure is an inevitable part of learning new skills, but trying something too far beyond your current ability can be debilitating. The TidyBlocks project was built on Google's `blockly`, a JavaScript library for building programming editors. I wasn't starting with a completely blank console, I had code to try to understand, and eventually build on. 

I spent my first month or so understanding the library, then eventually creating custom blocks to import, transform, and visualize data. I'd go to bed perplexed, and in the morning jump out of bed with a solution. Git allowed me to make code worse before it got better. Eventually I even stopped referring to Happy Git with R. I learned how to work in branches and review code. I no longer questioned my abilities, figuring things out became a matter of when.

A little over halfway through the internship I had a working user interface and a palette of blocks. I found myself looking at the code written at the beginning of the internship and squirming. I could write this again. Better.

A fresh repo with endless possibilities, the code was cleaned up and abstracted. Once functioning, the webpage was overhauled again to use the `react.js` framework, a popular tool for front end web developers.

I could talk about the specifics of the tool I developed, but I think what's more important was that this internship gave me the space to learn tools and concepts I wanted to master by building something I am not only proud of, but know people can benefit from.
