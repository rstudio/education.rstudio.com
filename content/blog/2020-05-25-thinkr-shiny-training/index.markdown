[ThinkR](https://thinkr.fr/) is running 10 half-days of remote training on "Shiny in Production" in July 2020.
The training will be done in English,
and some of the teaching methods are based on the concepts from RStudio's
[instructor training program](http://education.rstudio.com/trainers/).
To reduce confusion while navigating through multiple PDFs, the RStudio IDE, and the file manager,
ThinkR has built an e-learning platform that embeds everything learners need in one interface,
which you can see at <https://rtask.thinkr.fr/remote-trainings-and-certification/>.
For more information or to register,
