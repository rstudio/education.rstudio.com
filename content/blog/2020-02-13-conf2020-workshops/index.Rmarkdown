In January, we wrapped up [rstudio::conf(2020)](https://rstudio.com/conference/)&mdash;our fourth conference about all things R, RStudio, and data science. This year, the conference was held in San Francisco, California. Before the conference, we offered 19 (mostly) two-day workshops taught by RStudio staff as well as experts throughout the R community. Topics ranged from R for Excel Users, Javascript for Shiny Users, to Deep Learning with Keras and Tensorflow. With a teaching staff of 102 and 1307 workshop attendees, our instructors worked overtime to craft learning experiences that both challenged and empowered learners.

This year, the RStudio Education team designed a workshop line-up that we hope offered something for everyone. Some of our tried-and-true workshops were offered, but we also welcomed some new kids on the block, many by popular demand from attendees who weighed in on our post-conf surveys in the past. We were excited to work with new instructors from around the world, and to bring our conference attendees a slate of unique R-focused workshops.

For learners who attended workshops as well as those who could not join us, all workshop materials this year are available [online](https://github.com/rstudio-conf-2020) with [CC BY-SA 4.0 licenses](#licensing). Even though the materials alone cannot replace the actual workshop experience, we hope that you’ll find them useful. Instructors will be blogging individually about their workshops as well, so [watch this space](/tags/conf2020) for some repo roadmaps to help you navigate their workshop materials. RStudio also regularly hosts workshops throughout the year so please subscribe to [training updates](https://www.rstudio.com/about/subscription-management/). 

Thanks to all our instructors, teaching assistants, and workshop attendees this year&mdash;we hope to teach and learn together again in 2021 in [Orlando](https://rstd.io/conf)!
