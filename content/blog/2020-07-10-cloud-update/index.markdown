> RStudio Cloud spans across multiple teams at RStudio, so this is a joint post from the RStudio education, marketing, and Cloud teams.

After an extensive alpha/beta period, [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.com/products/cloud/) will be generally available for use and purchase in the fall. If you are not familiar with [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.com/products/cloud/), it is a managed cloud instance of the RStudio IDE. For educators, this means you and your learners can use the RStudio IDE directly from your browser - there is no software to install and nothing to configure on your computer. 

If you have been one of the many educators who have used and provided feedback about RStudio Cloud during this alpha/beta period, we sincerely thank you for helping us make this product better. We wanted to take this opportunity to communicate with current and future users about the upcoming changes you can expect now as you look towards teaching with RStudio Cloud this fall.

While RStudio Cloud will always offer a free plan for individuals, beginning August 3, 2020, we will also offer paid premium plans for individuals, instructors, and organizations. At RStudio, we're committed to supporting educators using R. That is why we offer [our](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio-server-pro/) [professional](https://rstudio.com/products/connect/) [products](https://rstudio.com/products/package-manager/) for free. We'd love to also make RStudio Cloud free for everyone, but unfortunately RStudio Cloud is fundamentally different from our other professional products because it is not just software, but is also computing. During the beta period, we provided 3.5 million hours of compute time for free. Unfortunately, we just can't afford to keep doing that &mdash; we need to need to cover our ongoing hosting costs so that we can continue to offer the service. In short: the fees help us offset the cost of operating the service, and enable us to continue to provide a free plan for individuals.

## What are my options for teaching? {#teachers}

The monthly pricing plans are available at <https://rstudio.cloud/plans/>. Typically, your learners will sign up for the [**Cloud Free Plan**](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free), and you as an educator will shoulder all the costs for your learners (called "members" in the plans). Here, we break down your options with a focus on teaching classes or workshops:

1. [**Cloud Free Plan**](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free): You can have one shared space at a time, with up to 5 learners and up to 15 total projects in the shared space. You *and* your learners will need to be able to do all the work in the cloud needed in 15 project hours per month. With the max of 5 learners, this would add up to about 2.5-3 compute hours per person (there are additional restrictions on CPU and RAM). This plan is best-suited for educators who offer short, small group trainings that are spaced a month apart. Otherwise, you'll need to pay for a plan that is less restrictive.
    
1. The next plan up does not have any restrictions on the number of spaces, learners, or projects, and there is more CPU and RAM available. You do have 160 project hours to divvy up now between learners. This would give you about a full 8-hour day of compute time for 20 learners, or a half-day for 40 learners (overages are 20Â¢/hour). Pricing for this plan depends on a few factors:

    - If you are not a qualified instructor or an [RStudio Certified Instructor](/trainers), this is called a [**Cloud Premium Plan**](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/premium) and starts at \\$99/month. However, discounted plans range from \\$25-\\$50/month, so be sure to check to see if your organization falls into one of the discounted categories listed at the bottom of the plan page.
    
    - If you are a qualified instructor (either teaching at an accredited institution that meets certain qualifications[^1], or you are an [RStudio Certified Instructor](/trainers)), this is called a [**Cloud Instructor Plan**](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/instructor) and starts at \\$15/month.

    If you want to avoid overage charges, this plan is probably best-suited for folks who offer single or multi-day workshops about once a month, or educators who want to start off using the Cloud, but then transition learners to working locally inside the RStudio IDE.
        
1. [**Custom Cloud Instructor Plan**](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/instructor): If you are teaching a quarter or semester length course, you are likely looking at burning through those 160 project hours pretty quickly and are probably worried about overage charges (rightly so!). For example, in a typical 3-credit course, you may expect learners to log upwards of 10 hours per week. This would mean you could only have 4 learners&mdash;which is probably not a realistic scenario. In this case, an alternative plan is to sign up for a fixed price per class for both instructors and learners with no usage overage fees. With this plan, you will need to request a quote. Tell us how many learners you will have, and for how long, and we can give you a custom quote for the entire cost.

1. [**Cloud Organization Plan**](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/organization): A final option for educators at commercial organizations is an organization plan. This plan enables multiple people in your organization to use the same RStudio Cloud account. This plan includes all Cloud Premium features, plus Single Sign On integration via SAML, and flexible pricing. This plan is also a good option if you would like a site license for your organization.

## What about options for learners? {#learners}

In most cases, your learners can rely on the [**Cloud Free Plan**](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free). If you as the educator opt for any of the paid plans:

+ Learners work off of project copies in **your** shared space. When you create a project in your shared space as an assignment, learners make a copy to work from, but the projects stay in the shared space. This means that the limit on the number of projects in the free plan (15) will not kick in *unless* a learner manually moves their projects out of the shared space and into their personal space.

+ Similarly, when learners accumulate project hours, those apply to **your** shared space. All learner project hours count toward your 160 project hours on a paid plan (unless you are using a [**Custom Cloud Instructor Plan**](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/instructor)). This means that the limits on the number of project hours in the free plan (15) will not kick in *unless* a learner manually moves their projects out of the shared space and into their personal space.

We sincerely thank all member of the R community who have used and provided feedback about RStudio Cloud. We are definitely aware that for many universities, budgets are very tight, particularly at this time. We will continue to do what we can to make Cloud as affordable as possible for instructional use. We will also continue to add important features and improve performance, reliability, and availability of RStudio Cloud.
