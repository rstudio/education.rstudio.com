  Welcome to the new RStudio Education website! We are working hard to make this site the place to go for everyone who wants to learn or teach data science with R and RStudio.

Hello and welcome to the RStudio Education website! We hope to make [education.rstudio.com](/) a community resource for everyone who wants to [learn](/learn/) or [teach](/teach/) data science with R and RStudio.

RStudio's mission is:

> "To equip everyone, regardless of means, to participate in a global economy that rewards data literacy."

Our education team supports this mission broadly by supporting people who want to learn R (or learn new things in R), and those who want to teach them. This site is designed for both.

# What is on this site?

There are four main sections, which you'll always be able to find in the upper navigation bar:

+ [**Blog**.](/blog) This is the üÜï RStudio Education Team blog. Here, we'll post announcements for events and other resources as they come up, as well as general R education-related content that we are excited about sharing.

+ [**Learn**.](/learn) Our advice for how learners can expand their knowledge about R and popular packages from RStudio, like tidyverse and Shiny. You'll find three learning pathways to help you become productive in the minimum amount of time, based on your experience level: [beginner](/learn/beginner), [intermediate](/learn/intermediate), and [expert](/learn/expert). The content and links on these pages may change as new resources become available and grab our attention. So rest assured &mdash; this page will be kept up-to-date, but that also means that our recommendations might change too.

+ [**Teach**.](/teach) Our team has trained a lot of learners to use R for data science. Drawing on that experience, we've broken down our collective advice and resources into three separable and learnable skills: how to [teach](/teach/how-to-teach) *(in general)*, how to create [materials](/teach/materials) to teach R and data science, and how to [set up effective learning environments](/teach/tools) for teaching R and data science.

+ [**Certify**.](/trainers) In 2019, we launched an instructor training and certification program that aims to help people apply modern evidence-based teaching practices to teach data science using R and RStudio‚Äôs products, and to help people who need such training find the trainers they need. On this [page](/trainers), you can meet our Certified Trainers and find out more about the program and the application process.

So, welcome &mdash; we are happy you found us!

# About the team


Who is the RStudio Education team? We are a small team of data scientists and professional educators. Our team is fully remote, spanning from Scotland to Oregon state. Meet each of us [here](/author/).

Our team members attend and present at workshops around the world. You can find out who will be where by checking our [upcoming events calendar](/events/). If you'll be at the same event too, please come say hi and introduce yourself. Our team loves to talk about all things data science and education, and we'd love to meet you in person.

You can also follow our work at the [RStudio Education GitHub Organization](https://github.com/rstudio-education/). All of our work [there](https://github.com/rstudio-education/), including training materials and workshops, is openly-licensed and freely-available for reuse. 

To find out more about the Education team's goal of adding the next million new R users to our community, you can watch this [rstudio::conf 2019 talk](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/the-next-million-r-users) from RStudio's Director of Education, [Carl Howe](/authors/carl/).
