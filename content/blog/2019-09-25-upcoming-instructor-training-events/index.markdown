Over two dozen people are now certified instructors and listed in our [trainers' directory](https://rstd.io/trainers),
and more are in the pipeline.
If you would like to join them,
the first step is to take part in one of our upcoming training classes.
We held a full class for people in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (Sept 16-17),
and another full class started today (Sept 25-26) for people in the Americas. 

We still have some space in two upcoming classes:

1. December 9-10, 2019; a two-day online session, and
1. January 28, 2020; a one-day training workshop that will take place in person at [rstudio::conf 2020][conf].

These come on top of a dozen other offerings this year:

-   one at rstudio::conf 2019
-   three for people in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa
-   another four targeting the Americas
-   one for East Asia and Australia/New Zealand
-   one for our interns, and
-   two for specific customers' teams.

The online course runs 4 hours each day (i.e., two back-to-back half-days);
the materials are [available online][slides],
and a book-length version is [also available][t3].
After completing the course,
participants must do one exam on teaching
and one each on the technical topics (tidyverse and/or Shiny).
If you would like to take part,
please fill in [this form][form] to tell us about yourself
or mail [Greg Wilson](mailto:greg.wilson@rstudio.com) if you have questions.
