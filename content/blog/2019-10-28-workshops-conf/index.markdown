rstudio::conf(2020) is fast approaching, and in addition to the many fantastic 
talks lined up for the conference, we're very much looking forward to the Training 
Days, which will feature a whopping 19 2-day workshops!

Below is a closer look at each of these workshops. We hope that this information 
can help you decide which one to attend. It's a tough decision!

And once you make up your mind, you can head over to 
[rstd.io/conf](https://rstd.io/conf) register for the conference and sign up 
for a workshop. Please note that some workshops may fill up; to see how many spots are available, click on the link above and select "Agenda" from the top menu. Also, workshop-only registration for the conference will open up November 1.
