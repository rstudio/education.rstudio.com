  Meet this year's interns.
---

We received almost two hundreds applications for
[this year's internship program][announcement],
and while we wish we could have offered positions to everyone,
in the end we were only able to select five:

- [Simon Couch](https://simonpcouch.com/): tidymodels package support
- [Ezgi Karaesmen](https://www.ezgikaraesmen.com/): interactive tutorials for tidymodels.
- [Devin Johnson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devinljohnson/): support for people working with spreadsheets in R.
- [JooYoung Seo](https://jooyoungseo.com/): accessibility improvements.
- [Nischal Shrestha](http://nischalshrestha.me/): interactive tutorials for Python.

They will all start in May,
and will blog here regularly about their progressâ€”we are looking forward to working with them.
